# Setup Instructions

In order to use the app you will need to create an API key through Yelp's website. Create a Yelp developer account here and follow prompts to obtain an API key: https://www.yelp.com/login?return_url=%2Fdevelopers%2Fv3%2Fmanage_app.

Once created, save a file called ".env" in the same directory that the restaurant_randomizer.py file is saved and place inside the phrase: "YELP_API_KEY = "Your Yelp API Key here"".
